# Mortgage-and-Savings

Short program that can calculate how much house you can afford based on Dave Ramsey's principals. It also has a savings calculator which calculates how much you would need to save monthly given a end amount and time goal.

Dave Ramsey's principals for a mortgage are: 
    
- That you use a 15 year fixed rate mortgage.
- The monthly payment is no more than 25% of your pay after taxes, but before other deductions such as health insurance and 401k

Both the mortgage and savings calculator are based on an annual interest rate of 4.35%
